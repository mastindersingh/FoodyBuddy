# Background
A lot of people want to try different food but do not have willingness to do so. One reason might be because their friends are not interested in trying different food, or they do not like the restaurant they are planning to go to. The food lover can choose to go alone, but why go alone when there are plenty of like-minded people out there who loves to try different food just as much as them? This is also a chance to get to know more people of different backgrounds.
<br><br> Foody Buddy is an Android mobile app that allows people who love the same type of food to find each other and eat together. We build this app based on a simple idea: we want to help people to break their routine lifestyle, to create more possibilities in life, by connect people with their favorite food. Users can invite others to eat together by send broadcast message to other users nearby, and those who joined the same event can start to chat with each other. Users can comment or follow the event they interested in, as well as get friend recommendation based on the food type they interested in.
